TAKEN FROM https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/681864/ : "Section 3.3 - Keeping to TurboWarp Formatting."

If you're programming your extension all for yourself, TurboWarp formatting won't have too much of an affect on your code.
However, if you want to submit your extension to the Official TurboWarp Unsandboxed Extension Gallery, 
there's a few rules you have to follow.

For one, most if not all copyrighted material is usually difficult to add to an extension, 
there's some stuff you can fill out to gain access to it, however that's legal stuff and legal stuff is boring.
Basically, stay away from copyrighted material or code snippets if at all possible.

As for the code itself, GarboMuffin prefers if you use semicolons and double spaces
(which is absolutely preposterous but it what it is I guess).

GarboMuffin will also usually turn down extensions that can be deemed dangerous, such as two extensions that are currently in limbo,
Local Storage and JavaScript Execution. As long as your extension isn't dangerous to the user, you shouldn't have to worry about that.

Any libraries that the extension uses must be embedded into the code of the extension,
and the extension should be able to work on all browsers.

Extensions must not return empty in a boolean or reporter.
An empty string (such as ‘ ’) is acceptable, but it needs to return something.
