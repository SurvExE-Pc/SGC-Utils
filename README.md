Current version: 6.2

a turbowarp extension I made.

DO NOT SUBMIT BUG REPORTS FOR AN OLDER VERSION
If you really need a bug fixed message me at @0znzw on scratch or email me(a_2oo@outlook.com).

most notable features:
   AES+RSA Encryption
   <br>
   Hashing beyond MD5.

<hr>
Versions 1.0-3.0 have some weird bugs, and do not abide by the turbowarp guidlines.
Version 5.0 and above broke compatibility between versions 1.0 - 4.0
Version 6.0 broke compatibility with 5.0

<h5>f1:</h5>
md5, sha1, sha128(broken), sha256, sha512, 32Bit Fn-1a, 

<h5>f2:</h5>
Unicode requires the string to be at least 2 characters long, and only encodes the first character.
Cloud is an option but is currently broken, so use Numerical Encodings instead.

<h5>f3:</h5>
The I36 Encoding is custom, and has 0 support for floating point numbers

<h5>f4:</h5>
The RSA Encryption method requires you to run the "Setup Librarys" block to work.
RSA HAS BEEN HIDDEN AS IT GOES AGAINST TURBOWARP GUIDLINES BUT IS STILL THERE DUE TO COMPATIBILITY ISSUES

<h5>f5:</h5>
Special broadcasts are:
<ul>
<li>Onetime (runs 1 time, can be reset)</li>
<li>everysecond (runs 1 time a second)</li>
</ul>

<h5>f6:</h5>
The deleting sprites block in this has 0 confirmation, and was made as an extra block for Shovel-Utils
